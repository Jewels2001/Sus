                            You were invited to a house party this weekend by a close friend,
                                and have decided to attend! The suggested theme was *candy*, so you
                                brought a bowl of 
                            
                            <div class="candy-display container"> M&Ms </div>
                            to the party.
                            <p></p>Suddenly, the host -- your friend
                            <div class="friend-display container"> Bethany</div>
                            -- rushes into the room, claiming that someone has died after eating the candy!
                                All of the candy was brought here, so someone must have brought poisoned candy -- and
                                no one has left, so they must still be in the building!
                                It is up to you to deduce who did it, with what candy, and what room they are hiding out in!
                                (before YOU are poisoned, too)
